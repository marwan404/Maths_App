📘 Math Topic Question Finder 🔍
Your personal IGCSE-style math past paper search engine.

Hey everyone! After hours of planning, coding, debugging, and building a custom database — I'm proud to finally release my new app: Math Topic Question Finder. 🎉

🧠 What It Does
This app helps students find past paper questions by topic, pulled from a custom-made database. Just select the topic (like "algebra", "trigonometry", "statistics", etc.), and the app instantly shows:

📅 Year

✍️ Final Thoughts
This project took a lot of learning, tweaking, and self-discipline — from designing flowcharts to building the database and writing a clean, understandable codebase. I wanted to make something genuinely helpful for students preparing for their math exams.

Let me know what you think, and feel free to fork, improve, or use it as inspiration for your own projects. 😄

Thanks for reading — and happy revising! 🧠📚
