# 📘 Math Topic Question Referral App

Welcome! This is a simple C++ console app that helps students quickly **find IGCSE-style math past paper questions** based on topic.

## 🔍 What It Does

You select a topic from a menu (like Algebra, Trigonometry, Statistics, etc.), and the app will display:

- ✅ Year  
- ✅ Session  
- ✅ Variant  
- ✅ Question Number  
- ✅ Marks  

All data is pulled from a custom-built CSV database (2024 papers only till now).

## 🤔 Why I Built It

As a student, I found myself constantly flipping through past papers just to find specific types of questions for revision. So I decided to build something that could **do it automatically**.

I wrote all the code myself in C++, learned how to handle CSV parsing, flowcharts, enums, and more — no tutorials, just learning by doing 💻✨

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Program prompts you to pick a topic.
2. It searches through `database.csv`.
3. Displays all relevant questions in a neat format.
